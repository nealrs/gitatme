This week's project could be titled: _Fun with Unity_ and it's just plain cool. [{{page.an}}]({{page.project}}) implemented the [Teddy algorithm](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/seminar/igarashi-et-al-1999.pdf
) in Unity. You freeform sketch a 2D shape, and the algo uses it to create a 3D object.

[Play with the demo on your computer]({{page.demo}}). It's crazy satisfying, but will probably crash your phone.
