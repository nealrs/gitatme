`cat` is a great command line utility. It prints files to the console. It also combine multiple files into one. You can even `cat` together non-text files like mpegs!

Unfortunately, you can't `cat` images to the console, which is a pain in the ass. Of course, OSX has _spacebar preview_, but you have to leave the console for that and it only works on Macs. ðŸ˜‘

Fortunately, <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong> saw an opportunity and created <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, a C application which, _surprise_, prints images to the console:

<center><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{page.pn}} screenshot" ></center>

Sure, it's blocky and coarse, but it's also fast and it works. Now I can edit text files, preview an image without switching windows, and go back to whatever I was doing. And yes, you can now `cat` _cats_. ðŸ˜¸

You can specify a desired height / width, or {{page.pn}} will default to the width of your current terminal.
