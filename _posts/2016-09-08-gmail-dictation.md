The massive success of voice UIs like Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and Alexa, sometimes makes me nostalgic for the era when voice recognition was awful. One summer in the 90s, my dad tried (to no avail) to train _Dragon Dictate_ to recognize his voice.

Fortunately, things have gotten better since 1997. Instead of pricey box software & fax machines with have free APIs and smart phones.

But, if you are feeling nostalgic for the _Dragon Days_, install [{{page.an}}' {{page.pn}}]({{page.project}}) Chrome extension and [dictate your next email](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-dictation/eggdmhdpffgikgakkfojgiledkekfdce). Google's WebSpeech API does all the heavy lifting, so it's pretty accurate. Just remember the punctuation keywords: _comma_, _period_, and _question mark_.

While mostly a parlor trick, I think {{page.pn}} a great way to get your notes / first draft down while your thoughts are still fresh.

Give it a try, I think you'll really like it!
