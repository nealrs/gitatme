So, I've been writing Git@Me continuously for about 3 years now. It's cuckoo pants, right? Well, I fell behind the 8-ball this week and didn't have time to get a full issue together.

Instead, I think you should read [{{page.an}}'s writeup]({{page.ipy}}) about how he used his cellphone, Julia, and a heap of computer vision to push for better traffic controls on the road between Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh.

As a CMU grad who spent a lot of time at Pitt, this resonated with me, plus it's exactly what civic and public advocacy hacking is all about!
