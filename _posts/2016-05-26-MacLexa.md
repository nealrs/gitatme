I recently bought an Amazon Echo and I've been having a lot of fun asking Alexa to tell me about the weather, play my favorite songs, and set timers in the kitchen&mdash;all hands free.

I haven't hacked with it yet, but my buddy <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong> wrote a cool Swift app that puts Alexa in your Mac's system tray. Unlike the Echo, <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> is entirely software based and only listens when you press the option key.

Whenever you record a command, it's sent to Alexa for processing and returns a voice response. Try downloading the binary and asking Alexa to tell you a joke.

{{page.pn}} also lets you process audio client-side and is a great tool for demoing your Alexa hacks without any Amazon hardware.

Follow the instructions in the <strong><a href="{{page.readme}}" title="{{page.pn}} readme on GitHub" target="_blank">readme</a></strong>, create an Alexa app, and _talk_ to her.
