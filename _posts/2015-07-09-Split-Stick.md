All puzzle games (Tetris, 2048, Angry Birds, Dots, etc.) get harder as you progress, but it's rarely a surprise. Gameplay tends to be predictable and repetitive. You move to a new level. The blocks move faster. You need to get a power up. There's more blue dots than red dots. There's not much to learn after the first 5 minutes.

But with <strong><a href="{{page.cp}}" title="{{page.pn}} on ChallengePost" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, nothing stays the same. Two players sharing a single controller must work together to control motion / action and figure out the rules as they go &mdash; because they keep changing!

Watch the video below to see how it works and affects the players. At best, they can anticipate that there _will be_ a change, but not how it will affect them. I think it's an awesome game mechanic.
