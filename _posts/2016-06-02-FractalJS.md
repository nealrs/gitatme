Here's an abridged history of my experience with fractals:

- **1992** Pops introduces me to the Mandelbrot set, Chaos Theory, and how everything keeps iterating as you zoom in. I'm unimpressed and wander off to play Nintendo.

- **1995** I accidentally turn off the computer (the monitor was off!) while my brother is rendering some crazy iterated fractal. Yelling ensues. I wander off to play Wolfenstein.

- **1999** We move to New Haven and pops stands behind Dr. Mandelbrot during some new teacher ceremony at Yale. Once again, I'm unimpressed. I wander off to play Xenogears.

- **2016** I discover the Burning Ship fractal and time stops. I am magnetically drawn to it, like it's calling out to me. Fractals are awesome and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.

Oddly, not many people on GitHub share my (newfound) love for fractals, but I did find a nice project called <strong><a href="{{page.demo}}" title="{{page.pn}} demo" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, which plots fractals online. (<strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.project}} source code on GitHub" target="_blank">Source code</a></strong>)

Zoom into the Burning Ship's tail, _the Armada_. The main ship reminds of a sinking oil tanker, while the Armada looks like a collection of grand Spanish galleons with tall rigging. Look closely and you might see the Black Pearl!

Learn more about the Burning Ship on <strong><a href="{{page.blog}}" title="Paul Bourke's blog on The Burning Ship fractal" target="_blank">Paul Bourke's blog</a></strong>. And FWIW, the difference between this fractal and the Mandelbrot set is relatively minor. Perhaps I owe Pops an apology.
