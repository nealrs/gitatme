People often ask me why, if I love coding so much, I haven't pursued a career in software development. I shrug and tell them I'm a hacker. Being a pro developer would take all the fun out of it because I'd have to follow 'best practices' (screw you PEP8), 'architect' solutions, do code reviews, use JIRA, and numerous other things that would kill my vibe.

Think about movie critics. In theory, they have the best job ever: watching movies all day. But, they're incapable of enjoying mindless action flicks like _The Fast & Furious_ because they have to focus on things like plot, character development, and the Bechdel Test.

This is all my way of saying, I've never used virtualenv when writing Python apps. I just `pip install` modules globally and get to hacking. And that's great because I never have to think about "did I install x?"&mdash;at least until it's time to deploy to Heroku.

Fortunately, I found another hacker out there who appreciates my philosophy. [{{page.an}}]({{page.author}})â€™s [{{page.pn}}]({{page.project}}) module generates requirements.txt files based on the libraries you're using, not just what you've installed in your environment (ðŸ–• pip freeze).

For example, my latest project has a lots imports spread across 3 or 4 source files:

```python
from flask import request, session, Flask, render_template, Response, redirect, url_for
from flask_cors import CORS, cross_origin
import requests
import json
import re
import random
from os import environ
import string
from datetime import datetime

import twilio
import twilio.rest
from twilio.rest.lookups import TwilioLookupsClient
import twilio.twiml

from sqlalchemy import *
from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError
from sqlalchemy.exc import CompileError
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, deferred
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

import cloudinary
import cloudinary.uploader
import cloudinary.api
```

But with pipreqs, I can run `pipreqs ~/path/to/app` and I get a perfectly formatted requirements file:

```
cloudinary==1.4.0
Flask==0.11.1
Flask_Cors==2.1.2
requests==2.10.0
SQLAlchemy==0.9.4
twilio==3.8.0
```

Did I just blow your little _best practice, rule following, PEP addicted_ mind? Thought so. ðŸ˜Ž
