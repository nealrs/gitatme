A few years ago, HubSpot made waves a web site that suggested [you might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/). It was a revelation in a world heavy with jQuery plugins.

[{{page.an}}]({{page.author}}), a front-end developer at IBM, has taken that a step further with [{{page.pn}}]({{page.project}}), demonstrating how capable modern browsers & CSS are, even without external scripts.

You should stop reading this post right now and [go check it out](http://youmightnotneedjs.com/). But if you need a little more prodding, here are my favorite examples:

1. [JS-less modal](http://youmightnotneedjs.com/#modal)
2. HTML only [form validation with regex patterns](http://youmightnotneedjs.com/#form_validation)
3. [Zero plugin accordion](http://youmightnotneedjs.com/#accordion)
