I simultaneously love &amp; hate Microsoft Excel. On the one hand, it's the gold standard for spreadsheet apps, _way_ faster than Google Docs, and gets shit done. On the other hand, I can crash it just by looking at it funny.

Where Excel falls short though, is connecting with programming languages outside of .NET. For ages, if you wanted to create, edit, or read Excel files, you had to resort to some really esoteric wizardry. But with <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, a node library by <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>, you can Excel with JavaScript.

Run the code below and check it against <strong><a href="{{page.file}}" download title="Download the example worksheet created with {{page.pn}}">my sample spreadsheet</a></strong>:

```javascript
var Excel = require('exceljs');

// create workbook & add worksheet
var workbook = new Excel.Workbook();
var worksheet = workbook.addWorksheet('Discography');

// add column headers
worksheet.columns = [
    { header: 'Album', key: 'album'},
    { header: 'Year', key: 'year'}
];

// add row using keys
worksheet.addRow({album: "Taylor Swift", year: 2006});

// add rows the dumb way
worksheet.addRow(["Fearless", 2008]);

// add an array of rows
var rows = [
  ["Speak Now", 2010],
  {album: "Red", year: 2012}
];
worksheet.addRows(rows);

// edit cells directly
worksheet.getCell('A6').value = "1989";
worksheet.getCell('B6').value = 2014;

// save workbook to disk
workbook.xlsx.writeFile('taylor_swift.xlsx').then(function() {
  console.log("saved");
});
```

Even if it only let you write spreadsheets with JSON, {{page.pn}} would be incredibly useful, but it also supports formulas, hyperlinks, merged cells, streams, and more.

Now go star this repo, because&mdash;_I've got a blank cell, baby and I'll type your name._
