Have you ever made that "OMG I thought it was on mute!" mistake? Trust me, no matter how Brooklyn you are, if your laptop starts playing Taylor Swift at a coffee shop, there's no way to recover. Your credibility is ruined. ðŸ™ˆ

Since it's easy to screw up and the social consequences dire, I recommend installing <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> from <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>.

{{page.pn}} monitors your wifi and mutes/unmutes the system volume based on which network you're connected to. Now, whenever I'm out on the road, my audio defaults off, but back at home it switches on full blast.

Functionally, {{page.pn}} is quite simple, but it demonstrates how a small contextual check can protect you from big gaffes.
