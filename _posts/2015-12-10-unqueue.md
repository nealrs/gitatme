Here's a real _#firstworldproblem_: every afternoon, I receive Dave Pell's excellent <strong><a href="http://nextdraft.com" target="_blank" title="NextDraft online">NextDraft</a></strong> newsletter and add the articles to my Pocket queue, so I can read them on the subway. The problem is, there are like 20+ links in each newsletter and adding each one to Pocket requires a ton of clicking &amp; swiping.

Fortunately, I hacked together a clever solution using a <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, a repo I found on GitHub.

Written by <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>, {{page.pn}} is a PHP web app that archives unread articles in your Pocket queue. Got 56 unread articles and want to delete them all? No problem, {{page.pn}} can do it in 2 clicks.

And while that's kind of the _opposite_ of what I want to do, Jesse's code was the perfect starting point for me, because it handles all the login and OAuth authentication junk required by Pocket's API. All I really had to do was modify the queuing code.

I started by scraping the current issue of NextDraft, extracting all of the story links from the HTML, and storing them in a session variable. I used an xpath query to do all the heavy lifting:

```php
<?php
  // get source of current issue & ignore all errors
  libxml_use_internal_errors(TRUE);
  $dom = new DOMDocument;
  $dom->loadHTMLFile('http://nextdraft.com/current');
  libxml_clear_errors();

  // setup xpath query
  // only want links from paragraph tags in blurb-content class divs
  $xp = new DOMXpath($dom);
  $links = $xp->query('//div[@class="blurb-content"]/p/a/@href');

  // load up array with links & store data in session variable
  $payload = array();
  for ($i = 0; $i < $links->length; $i++) {
    $payload[] = $links->item($i)->nodeValue;
  }

  // STORE URLS FOR LATERS
  $_SESSION['to_queue'] = $payload;
?>
```

After that, I used the OAuth tokens which {{page.pn}} obtained automagically,  looped through the array of links, and made calls to Pocket's `/add` API endpoint. (FYI, it'd be more efficient to use the `/send` end point in the future.)

That's it, really. You can see it in action below:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='{{page.video}}' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen alt="{{page.pn}} demo video"></iframe></div>

{{page.pn}} saved me _lots_ of time futzing with OAuth. If you're interested in hacking with Pocket, it's the first repo you should look at.

I call my hack <strong><a href="{{page.nextpocket}}" target="_blank" title="Go to NextPocket">NextPocket</a></strong> and you can use it right now, provided you have a Pocket account. I may also extend it for Instapaper or build a shell script instead of a web app, but right now, this is a perfect solution for me. And isn't that what great hacks are all about?
