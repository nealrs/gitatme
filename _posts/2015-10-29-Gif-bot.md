In Slack, everyone's favorite office chat <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">time waster</span>, you can post gifs really easily:

<img src="{{page.img}}" class="demo" alt="Giphy on Slack demo">

But Twitter, for all it's memey-ness, makes you upload gifs manually, like it's 2013 or something. Surely there's a better way, right?

Yep. It's called <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> and you can thank <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong> for saving you all those crucial seconds.

{{page.pn}} is a Python3 Twitter bot that, when mentioned, searches Giphy for an appropriate image and then tweets back at everyone mentioned - like this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/nealrs">@nealrs</a> <a href="https://t.co/LHYZVu2s7C">pic.twitter.com/LHYZVu2s7C</a></p>&mdash; slashgif (@slashgif) <a href="https://twitter.com/slashgif/status/658816109647237120">October 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Why is this so cool? Because {{page.pn}} is the ultimate Twitter bot starter kit. It handles all of the basics for you:

- Uses Tweepy to access Twitter's streaming API and listen for any mentions of itself and manages rate limiting
- Knows not to tweet back at itself, or to process RTs
- Converts hashtags into plain text and then turns the entire tweet (minus @mentions) into a search query
- Ensures that the outgoing tweet is no longer than 140 characters

The Giphy portion is straightforward too&mdash;it's like one API call, but you can swap that out for any action you want. Return a song from Spotify, a video from YouTube, or don't search at all and just RickRoll people on demand.

How am I going to use {{page.pn}}? I'm modding it to highlight my favorite Devpost projects with <strong><a href="{{page.escobar}}" title="Escobar demo gif" target="_blank">custom generated gif</a></strong> whenever I tweet about them. It's gonna be sweet.

Now, stop thinking about "wouldn't it be cool if when I tweeted&hellip;" and go build yourself a bot!
