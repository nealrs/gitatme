I've used pretty much every instant message & team collaboration tool ever (AIM, ICQ, IRC,  Sametime, HipChat, etc.) and these days it's all about Slack.

It's nice that you can edit Slack messages whenever you make a typo, but that means you have to mouse over, click edit, make your edit, click enter, etc. It's a whole thing.

But what if you could just do this instead?

<a href="{{page.img}}" title="{{page.pn}} demo"><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{page.pn}} demo" class="demo"/></a>

Pretty neat, hunh? Just type in your correction, like you would have on AIM and [{{page.pn}}]({{page.project}}) will update your original message. Bing. Bang. Boom!
