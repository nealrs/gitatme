There are literally _thousands_ of RPG software projects on GitHub. Despite 8th gen gaming consoles with photorealistic graphics, VR, and MMORPGs, people are still sitting around rolling dice.

Are we over engineering fun? ¯\\(ツ)/¯

Interested in building your own Nintendo-era _Final Fantasy_ game? There's a <strong><a href="http://ronenness.github.io/RPGUI/" title="RPGUI - Lightweight framework for old-school RPG GUI in web!" target="_blank">Bootstrap inspired CSS toolkit</a></strong> for that. And yes, there's an <strong><a href="https://github.com/nagoshiashumari/Rpg-Awesome" title="Rpg-Awesome - a fantasy themed font and CSS toolkit." target="_blank">RPG icon font</a></strong> modeled after Font-Awesome too.

If you're a D&D purist, you might scoff at the idea of <strong><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Risher/5e-DnD-Character-Generator" title="5e-D-D-Character-Generator - create characters for the game D&D (5th edition)" target="_blank">letting a computer create your character</a></strong>. But hey, software is eating the world, computers are winning at Go, and PHP can  <strong><a href="https://github.com/andreasindal/rpgfaker" title="RPGFaker is a library that can generate names for you to use in your fantasy games/fiction/whatever." target="_blank">come up with a name</a></strong> for your chaotic-neutral pyromancer.

And let's not forget about those dice. <strong><a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=dice+roll" target="_blank" title="dice roller repos on GitHub">I found over 100</a></strong> dice roll libraries. Whether you need something <strong><a href="https://github.com/lunanoko/rpg-dice" title="RPG Dice - Node module for rolling various types of dice" target="_blank">simple</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://github.com/GreenImp/rpg-dice-roller" title="rpg-dice-roller - A basic JS based dice roller that accepts typical dice notation" target="_blank">advanced</a></strong>, you'll find one in your favorite language.
