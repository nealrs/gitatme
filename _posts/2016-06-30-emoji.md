In the 90s I made my dad buy me a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565920414/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&me=) about _smileys_. He pointed out that I could find every possible combination of sideways smiles via gopher &amp; newsgroups, but I was determined to have it in print.

Today, weâ€™ve swapped sideways smileys for unicode emoji, which are superior in almost every possible way. To say they are immensely popular would be an understatement, [we canâ€™t design new emoji fast enough](http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/06/02/face-palm-pregnant-woman-among-72-new-emoji-coming-with-unicode-90).

Theyâ€™ve got their own secret meanings. Weâ€™ve brought them to life as [throw pillows](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/throwboy-emoji-pillows) & [pool floats](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/emoji-pool-floats). And we've built software around them:

Want to extract high quality PNGs from Appleâ€™s official emoji set? [Use this Ruby script](https://github.com/tmm1/emoji-extractor).

How about programmatically adjusting emoji skin tones? [You can do that with JavaScript](https://github.com/sindresorhus/skin-tone).

Need help finding the right emoji to complement your text? [Use machine learning](https://github.com/sindresorhus/emoj).

Even if our attention spans are decreasing & language diversity is drying up, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll all be able to find an emoji to express how we _just. canâ€™t. even_. ðŸ˜’
