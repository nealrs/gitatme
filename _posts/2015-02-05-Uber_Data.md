My friends and I are quite fond of Uber. It's a nice treat and we always arrive at our destination feeling like rockstars.

It's easy to forget that every ride generates a lot of data for Uber &mdash; data which is responsible for its $40B+ valuation. And since we created that data, we should have full access to it, right?

We do, _sort of_. You can <strong><a href="{{ page.trips }}" target="_blank" title="Your Uber account data">view your entire Uber history</a></strong> online, but there's no download button. So, although it's available, it's effectively landlocked.

Fortunately, <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong>, a civic & transit hacking icon, stepped up. His <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> allows you to download & liberate all of your ride data: fares, map traces, driver info, ride ratings, start/end addresses, time/date, etc. &mdash; all in one geoJSON file. Even the official API can't do that!

Here's a plot of all my rides in NYC. Can you tell where I live?
