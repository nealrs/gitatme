Every time somebody visits my apartment, I dread the question: "What's your wifi?" I honestly have no idea. It's been saved on my computer since like, _forever_. Whenever I get a new laptop, I'll have to buy a new router too.

But, wouldn't it be amazing if your computer could just _tell_ you the password? I mean, it's in there.

<strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong>'s aptly named <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> shell script does just that. One little terminal command is all your need &mdash; No sticky notes. No guessing. No hassle.

{{page.pn}} works on OSX and there's also a Windows port.
