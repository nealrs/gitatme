One of the best parts of GitHub is forking. See a repository that you want to use or modify? Just fork it and you've got your own copy to play around with.

However, GitHub will only let you clone a repo once. You can't fork your own repos either.

So, if I wanted to create a new project starting with my <strong><a href="{{page.orig}}" title="Derptype boilerplate on GitHub" target="_blank">derptype</a></strong> boilerplate, I'd have to initialize a new repo on my machine, create a gh-pages branch, download / unzip / copy over the html/css files, and deploy it back to GitHub. That's a lot of work just to create a _copy_ of my own code.

Which is why you need to buy <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong> a beer. He wrote a command line utility for copying repos. Fittingly, it's called <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>.

There are a few advantages of cloning vs. creating a new repo & copying over the source files:

- {{page.pn}} creates 1:1 copies, including branches, git history, etc.
- Cloned repos aren't linked to a remote head / upstream.
- You can fork a repo as many times as as you want.
- {{page.pn}} can create new repos on the fly.
- You can clone a repo with a short 1 liner from the console.

I used {{page.pn}} to clone <strong><a href="{{page.clone}}" title="Derptype2 cloned repo on GitHub" target="_blank">derptype2</a></strong> from my original derptype repo &mdash; `mirror nealrs/derptype to nealrs/derptype2 -c`

FYI, to use this compact form of the CLI, you have to create a personal GitHub token with repo permissions and set a couple environment variables. Otherwise, you must specify `-u` and `-t` params every time. Not a big deal, but I'm just saying.
