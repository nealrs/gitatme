&#35;Realtalk, Chrome is _killing_ me. Sure, it's got excellent feature support and developer tools, but it can also crush a quad-core MacBook. You know what I mean, right? You right click to open a few dozen tabs and your Chrome &mdash; if not your whole machine &mdash; slows to a crawl and then freezes up.

And while you probably don't _need_ all 20 of those Amazon &amp; Pinterest tabs, I know you're going to open them anyway ðŸ˜’ So, you might as well install <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, a node app from the prolific <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>.

{{page.pn}} intentionally crashes all of your Chrome tabs, freeing up RAM, reducing system load, and saving your battery. But, since it doesn't _close_ any of your tabs, you can reload them at any time to restore them. No harm, no foul. And it's available for Windows, OSX, and Linux.

Is this overkill? Perhaps, but Chrome has become a victim of it's own success. Extensions run amok, AJAX reloads continuously in the background, and even ad blockers are major resource hogs. If you want to enjoy the web again, you need to kill your tabs.
