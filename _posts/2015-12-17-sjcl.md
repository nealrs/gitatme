_FYI, I'm on vacation in Costa Rica, so this is the last Git@Me of 2015. Pura vida mae!_

It's holiday season and my family &amp; friends keep asking for my mailing address. Frankly, I'm surprised holiday cards are still a thing. (My parents declared holiday card/newsletter bankruptcy decades ago.) Save a tree and send me an email with funny gifs instead.

I briefly considered posting my address on my website, but I didn't want tons of spam. So, I needed a way to put it online and restrict access to people who actually know me.

I figure that if you can spell my middle name and you know my phone number, you can probably figure out or socially engineer my mailing address. So, here's what I came up with. I call it <strong><a href="{{page.demo}}" target="_blank" title="Cryptopostal demo">Cryptopostal</a></strong>:

<a href="{{page.demo}}" target="_blank" title="Cryptopostal demo"><img src="{{page.gif}}" class="demo"></a>

## How it works

While it's trivial to create a web form that reveals something, securing it is not. A simple show/hide is insufficient, because the "hidden info" is stored as plaintext in the source code. A secure alternative would be a database lookup using name &amp; phone as the login credentials, but that's a colossal waste of resources for this application.

The answer is **crypto**. By encrypting my address, I can store it in the source code, and decrypt it locally whenever a visitor provides the proper answers. It's 100% static and _supes_ elegant.

I looked at a bunch of cryptography libraries, but I chose the <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} homepage" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> (SJCL) because it's small, maintained, works locally in the browser & in node, and it has a super simple API.

How simple? This simple:

```javascript
// encrypt data
var e = sjcl.encrypt("passphrase", "secret message")

//decrypt data
var d = sjcl.decrypt("passphrase", e)
```

Using the correct answers (name + phone) as my passphrase, I encrypted three strings and stored them as JavaScript variables:

- `e1`, a random string of characters ~ `sup3rs3kr1t` (this could be any random string of characters.)

- `e2`, the address (br is optional / for line breaking) ~ `1060 W Addison St.<br>Chicago, IL 60613`

- `e3`, a Google Maps link ~ `https://goo.gl/92pTKS`

Whenever a visitor submits the form, a script does the following:

- Sanitize and concatenate the name and phone inputs into a passphrase.

- Decrypt `e1` and compare it to the plaintext `sup3rs3kr1t`. If it's a match, our answers are correct.

- If it matches, decrypt `e2` & `e3`, update placeholder HTML elements with those strings, and then unhide the address field.

- If it doesn't match, display an error message.

As you can see in my 80s inspired demo, it's pretty neat.

## Roll your own

I wrote a node package that will generate a Cryptopostal page for you:

1. <strong><a href="{{page.repo}}" target="_blank" title="Cryptopostal on GitHub">Clone the repo</a></strong>
2. Run `npm install`
3. Edit variables in `index.js` (name, avatar, q1, q2, pass, d1, d2, d3)
4. Run `node index.js` to update `index.html`
5. Upload `index.html` & all the css/js/image assets to you web host. Do _not_ upload index.js.
