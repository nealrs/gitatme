description: "After 3 years and over 160 issues, Git@Me is going biweekly / whenever I have something great to write about."
issue: 162

---

When I started Git@Me, my life was very different. I had never been to a hackathon. I barely understood git & APIs. And I desperately needed a creative outlet to get past my boring job in ad tech.

Thanks to some great advice from Kuan Huang at Poncho, I stopped thinking about writing and started doing it.

Since then I've published over 160 issues. I changed careers to DevRel. I've been to a jillion hackathons (both as a hacker & for Devpost). I've written dozens of Chrome extensions. And I started a bunch of video projects [The Commit](http://devpost.com/thecommit) (job advice for hackers) and [Wakey Wakey](http://wakey.io) (videos about cool tech, science, and other cool stuff).

But, over the past few months, Git@Me hasn't been very good. I've been pushing myself to publish at the expense of quality. I'm perpetually exhausted and you deserve better.

So here's the deal: I'm only going to publish when I've got something I'm _really excited_ about. Hopefully that'll be biweekly.

Thank you so much for exploring open source with me and I hope you stick around.
