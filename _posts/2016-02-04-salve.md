Are computer viruses still a thing? Like, do people actually run antivirus software? Today's main malware is for surveillance and identity theft. Not the old school, 80s/90s skull & bones, crash your computer stuff.

These days, most of our files are in the cloud. And we love uploading data too. We actually _want_ it to go viral. So, perhaps it's incumbent upon us data creators, sharers, and service providers to make sure we're not doing any harm. Right?

If you host files on s3, you can do your part by scanning uploads with <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>. Written by the team at <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>, {{page.pn}} uses Amazon's own  messaging & queuing services, plus the ClamAV antivirus engine to identify infected files on s3.

It works like this:

1. You upload a file to Amazon
2. Amazon tells Salve to scan the file
3. Salve tells Amazon (and you) if the file is clean or not

Here's a more complete diagram from the project repo:

I like {{page.pn}} because it's small, you can deploy it with Docker, it continually keeps its virus definitions up to date, and it's cheap to run on Elastic Beanstalk.

Clean the cloud. The Internet will thank you.
