This week's project, <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, combines two of my favorite things, email &amp; reading, in one really cool hack.

With <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong>'s node app, you can read almost anything via email. Just forward the URL to a special email address (fetch@to.andyjiang.com) and it'll reply back with the plaintext content.

For example, you can take a story from last week's <strong><a href="{{ page.db }}" target="_blank" title="Das Brunch is awesome bro">Das Brunch newsletter</a></strong>, send the URL to {{page.pn}}, and read it offline / ad-free as an email:

<center><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{ page.pn }} demo"></center>

{{page.pn}} won't replace Instapaper / Pocket, but it _will_ let you focus on reading without any signups, accounts, or extra apps. _#emailiseverything_

<center><a href="{{ page.url }}#comments" class="btn btn-primary btn-comment" title="Discuss this issue of Git @ Me online">Do you even comment bruh?</a></center>
