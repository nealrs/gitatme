JSON is the _lingua franca_ of APIs. We `GET` it. We `POST` it. We `UPDATE` it. We may even `DELETE` it every now and then. And as long as the JSON flows, our apps run and things are good.


But, while JSON is easy for _machines_ to read, humans tend to have more trouble with it. The infinite nesting. The endless brackets, braces, colons, commas, and quotes -- you could easily go cross eyed trying to parse it all.

Here's an example from a project that I'm working on:

```json
{
  "gameData" : [ {
    "prompt" : {
      "delay" : 10,
      "msg" : "Bruh",
      "npc" : "1"
    },
    "triggers" : {
      "*" : 2
    }
  }, {
    "prompt" : {
      "delay" : 10,
      "goto" : "3",
      "msg" : "Last night was NUTS!!!!!",
      "npc" : "1"
    }
  }, {
    "prompt" : {
      "delay" : 25,
      "msg" : "We going again tonight?",
      "npc" : "1"
    },
    "triggers" : {
      "no" : "5",
      "yes" : "4"
    }
  }, {
    "prompt" : {
      "delay" : 20,
      "msg" : "Word, see you there!",
      "npc" : "1"
    }
  }, {
    "prompt" : {
      "delay" : 30,
      "msg" : "Aight, rest easy.",
      "npc" : "1"
    }
  } ]
}

```

That's a fairly shallow structure without much nesting, but it's still not super intuitive and it takes a lot of vertical space to make it readable. Compare that to a tabular view:

<img src="{{page.img}}" class="" alt="Sample {{page.pn}} output">

That's a lot easier to read, right? I created that table with a client-side JavaScript <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> written by 18F's <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>.

<strong><a href="{{page.demo}}" title="{{page.pn}} live demo" target="_blank">Try out the demo for yourself</a></strong>. All you have to do is paste in JSON and it'll convert it to CSV, give you a download link, and let you preview it as an HTML table.
