Have you ever wondered why more publishers don't have "Share on WhatsApp" buttons on their mobile sites?" I mean, it's pretty popular (500M+ users).

As with Facebook and Twitter, you can send data to WhatsApp through special _deep links_. The thing is, WhatsApp doesn't have a true web client, so there's no way to handle unsupported platforms or users without the app.

You can overcome all of that with <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>'s <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> plugin. It lets you embed deep links in web pages, manage visibility, and specify fallbacks for unsupported platforms.

For example, <strong><a href="{{page.sj}}" title="Summer Jam Hackathon Series" target="_blank">ChallengePost's Summer Jam site</a></strong> has a WhatsApp link that only shows up on mobile and prompts you to install the app if necessary.

<center><a href="{{page.demo}}" title="{{page.pn}} Demo" target="_blank"><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{page.pn}} in action" class="demo"></a></center>

All it took was two lines of code:

```html
<!--
This is a mobile-only WhatsApp deep-link. You can add an href attribute as a fallback.

FYI, message text must be URL encoded.
-->

<a data-app="whatsapp://send?text=Dude%2C%20ChallengePost%20Summer%20Jam%20looks%20sweet%21%20http%3A//summerjam.challengepost.com" data-store-android ="com.whatsapp" data-store-ios="310633997">Share on WhatsApp</a>


<!-- initialize the script before </body> -->
<script src="js/deep-link.js"></script>

```
The big win with {{page.pn}} is reduced user friction. And for Summer Jam, that means more sharing, more registrations, and more hacks!
