Real talk, making apps is hard &mdash; especially when you're flying solo. There's the UI, the code, the backend, external APIs, push notifications, app store approvals, etc. And once you've made it through _all_ of that, you still need to build a landing page. **Blerg**.

Fortunately, there's a shortcut: <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}'s</a></strong> landing page template for iOS apps. It's responsive, hackable, and covers just about everything:

- navigation
- screenshot gallery
- demo video
- copy to explain & highlight features
- about & team bios
- testimonials
- press mentions
- social media links
- contact form

<center><a href="{{page.demo}}"><img src="{{page.gif}}" alt="Click here for a live {{ page.pn }} demo" class="demo"></a></center>

FYI, you'll still have to write compelling copy & make a great app, but you _can_ cross "hours of tedious front-end development" off your todo list.
