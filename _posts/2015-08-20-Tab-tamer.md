Hi, my name is Neal and I'm a tab addict. At any given time, I've got 3-4 browser windows open, each with 5-25 tabs.

On multiple occasions, I've crashed my quad-core MacBook Pro just by opening a bunch of GitHub tabs. It's a real problem and I'm not the only one suffering:

Inspired by that tweet, <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong> is helping hopeless tab addicts like me reenter normal society with <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>.

Robin's Chrome extension only allows you to have 10 tabs open at a time. If you open an 11th tab, the leftmost one drops off. If you _really_ need to access closed tabs, you can always use the _History-> Recently closed_ menu option.

Here it is in action. Note how the orange Hacker News tab moves to the left and eventually falls off:

<video width="100%" autoplay loop controls>
    <source src="{{page.video}}" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

{{page.pn}} isn't in the Chrome store yet, but you can download and install it locally as an unpacked extension.
