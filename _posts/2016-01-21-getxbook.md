When I was searching for Kindle hacks, I came across <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.ann}}'s homepage'" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>'s <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} homepage" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> project, which enables you to download entire books from Google, Amazon (Look Inside previews), and Barnes & Noble. It's written in C and comes with some interesting utility scripts.

When you provide the appropriate {{page.pn}} program (`getabook` for Amazon) with a suitable identifier, it attempts to find all the image files that comprise the book preview and download them as JPGs.

To get a sample of Neal Stephenson's _Seveneves_ from Amazon, I'd run `getabook 0062190377`, which refers to the hardcover's ASIN number.

Additionally, with the `mkocrtxt.sh` script, you can use ImageMagick and  Tesseract to OCR and convert the images into a text file.

It's a bootleg solution, but still pretty neat. And with Google Books, it may just be worth it, since you can often download entire titles from Google.
