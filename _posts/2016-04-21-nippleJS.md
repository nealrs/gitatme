I went to an arcade on Sunday and mashed buttons until my hands were sore. You just don't get that same feeling playing Angry Birds.

But, if you want to build a classic action game and you're handy with JavaScript, download the <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> library from <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>.

{{page.pn}} creates touch-controlled joysticks that track movement, direction, angle, and pressure (if you've got an iPhone6s). Set up a listener and use the positional data to trigger actions in your app/game.

Two killer features:

1. You can position joysticks dynamically, so you don't have to keep your finger in the same place.
2. On multitouch devices, you can use two or more joysticks simultaneously.
