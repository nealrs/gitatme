_This is our 100th issue!!_

I joined a new gym last weekend and before the ink was dry, they gave me the hard sell for personal training. Betrayed by my Yale Hack t-shirt and slouchy shoulders, the head trainer quickly surmised that I work in tech, sit at a desk all day, have tight hips, and don't get much exercise beyond the elliptical.

So yeah, my first session is on Monday. ðŸ™ˆ

Perhaps, what I really need is to integrate fitness into my work routine. For example, I could setup <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}'s </a></strong> <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> plugin. ðŸ’ª

{{page.pn}} is, like any good invisible app, super simple. Once you set it up, it publically assigns a random team member to do pushups every 30-40 minutes. That's it. Of course, you can blow it off, but then you'll have to answer to your teammates. ðŸ˜±

<center><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{page.pn}} in action" class="demo"></center>

Add {{page.pn}} to your team by following the <strong><a href="{{page.readme}}" title="{{page.pn}} installation instructions" target="_blank">instructions in the readme</a></strong>.
