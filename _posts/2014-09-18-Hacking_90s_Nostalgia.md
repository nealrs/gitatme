I'm a sucker for great hacks, and after seeing over 230 of them at <strong><a href="{{ page.pa10 }}" target="_blank" title="PennApps X submission gallery">PennApps X</a></strong>, I really wanted to try something new: _hardware hacking_.

On Monday I borrowed a Leap Motion, installed the SDK, and started looking at tutorials & demos. Three days later, I have yet to write a single line of code.

Why? Because one of the first demos I found was <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> and I can't stop playing it. I blame 90s nostalgia.

<strong><a href="{{ page.team }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.pn }} team on ChallengePost">{{page.an}} and his team</a></strong> upgraded the classic Bop It game with gesture-controls for solo & competitive play &mdash; and it's just as addictive _(and infuriating)_ as the original.

In this video from <strong><a href="{{ page.pa9 }}" target="_blank" title="PennApps Spring 2014 submission gallery">PennApps Spring 2014</a></strong>, the team explains what inspired them and how their hack works:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Un50KKFU7E4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

If you have the hardware, {{page.pn}} is a really fun way relive the heady days of the 90s, back when MTV still played videos.

_FYI_ I had to patch the source, so you may want to <strong><a href="{{ page.myfork }}" target="_blank" title="my bopit fork">use my fork</a></strong>.
