I want to make an API this year, because it sounds like fun. My first experiment is _NealAPI_, which tells you everywhere I've lived, gone to school, and worked for the past 32 years.

NealAPI is powered by <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong>, <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong>'s Python port of <strong><a href="{{page.orig}}" title="PHP Instant-API on GitHub" target="_blank">the original PHP project</a></strong>. {{page.pn}} creates a RESTful web service from JSON files. There are no dependencies and it offers path-based navigation. For example:

- I went to grade school at `/neal/7/school`. <strong><a href="http://104.236.97.10:8080/neal/7/school" title="Click for the answer from NealAPI" target="_blank">(answer)</a></strong>
- After college I moved to `/neal/23/live`. <strong><a href="http://104.236.97.10:8080/neal/23/live" title="Click for the answer from NealAPI" target="_blank">(answer)</a></strong>
- During high school I worked at `/neal/18/work`. <strong><a href="http://104.236.97.10:8080/neal/18/work" title="Click for the answer from NealAPI" target="_blank">(answer)</a></strong>
- Now you can find me at `/neal/32`. <strong><a href="http://104.236.97.10:8080/neal/32" title="Click for the answer from NealAPI" target="_blank">(answer)</a></strong>

Since the I/O is all JSON, it's super easy to <strong><a href="{{page.json}}" title="NealAPI source data" target="_blank">create and maintain</a></strong> your API.
