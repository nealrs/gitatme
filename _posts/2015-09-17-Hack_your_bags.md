On my flight to Ann Arbor last Saturday, (yay MHacks 6!), my colleague Richard and I contemplated the unlikely possibility that someone would thieve the 35lb swag bag we checked in Newark.

Since 9/11, TSA locks have become a fact of life, but I never lock my luggage unless I'm going transatlantic. I mean, what's the point? Literally _thousands_ of bag inspectors and agents have master keys to the only acceptable locks in the US. It's an inherently insecure system and <strong><a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/2008/02/tsa-our-officers-public-and-theft.html" target="_blank"> even the TSA even acknowledges that agents steal</a></strong>.

Well now, things have come full circle. After the Washington Post published a story with high resolution photos of the TSA's master keys, dozens of nerds fired up SolidWorks and their 3D printers to test the inevitable: you can 3D print TSA master keys. (FYI, _never_ post photos of your keys online. Anyone with a Dremel / file can make a usable copy based on a good image.)

If you've got the hardware, <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong> has published a set of STL models <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">CAD models</a></strong> that are print ready. The repo includes both standard and 'stubby' key designs that save material and print faster.

Back in Ann Arbor, Richard watched, rapt, as a 3D printer tirelessly churned out gears, struts, and other contraptions for eager hackers. I, on the other hand, was perplexed, because I was sure we'd packed more men's tshirts.
