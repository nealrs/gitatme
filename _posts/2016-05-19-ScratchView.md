I don't care for the lotto, but I do love scratch off games like McDonald's Monopoly. There's something about scratching off the silver paint and revealing a secret message underneath.

Scratch offs are a neat UI mechanic and thanks to <strong><a href="{{page.author}}" title="{{page.an}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.an}}</a></strong>, you can use them in your next Android app. Their <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> library lets you create scratch offs with image or text:

<center>
  <img src="{{page.img1}}" class="demo" style="display: inline !important;" alt="{{page.pn}} ScratchImageView demo"> <img src="{{page.img2}}" class="demo" style="display: inline !important;" alt="{{page.pn}} ScratchTextViewdemo">
</center>

{{page.pn}} also has methods that can tell you whether the image/text has been revealed, force a scratch off event, or listen for a completed scratch off and fire off a callback.

Whether you use it in a captcha or to create interactive coupons, {{page.pn}} is a fun way to make your app more interactive.
