There are a lot of annoying growth hacky things you can do to get people to stay on your site. A common one is to popup a modal whenever a user moves his mouse toward the address bar. The modal then begs you to stay or subscribe for email updates. Frankly, it's a little needy.

But, when I saw [{{page.pn}}]({{page.project}}) from [{{page.an}}]({{page.author}}), I couldn't help but smile. It automagically changes the page title and favicon whenever the page loses focus.

<a href="{{page.img}}" title="{{page.pn}} demo"><img src="{{page.img}}" alt="{{page.pn}} demo" class="demo"/></a>

It's cute, easy to implement, and won't get in the way. Most importantly, it _might_ just convince a few visitors to click back.
