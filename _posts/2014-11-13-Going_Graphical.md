In my experience, scripts are easy, but GUIs aren't. Outside of web/mobile, going graphical has always been this elusive thing I couldn't grok&hellip;until recently.

The <strong><a href="{{page.project}}" title="{{page.pn}} on GitHub" target="_blank">{{page.pn}}</a></strong> GUI toolkit from <strong><a href="{{ page.author }}" target="_blank" title="{{ page.an }} on GitHub">{{page.an}}</a></strong> uses native OS widgets and is just an import away. I mashed it up with the Giphy API to make an <strong><a href="{{page.gist}}" title="{{page.pn}} demo app on GitHub" target="_blank">animated gif search app</a></strong>:

</center>

I wouldn't recommend {{page.pn}} for any heavy lifting yet &mdash; it still has a ways to go &mdash; but it's great for zuzzing up your scripts with inputs, buttons, and webviews.
