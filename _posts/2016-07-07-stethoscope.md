Stethoscopes, basic listening devices, enable doctors to diagnose tons of medical conditions. But, despite their 200 year history and numerous expired patents, even simple models can cost over $100. That's way too much.

Enter Tarek Loubani's [{{page.an}}]({{page.author}}) project. Glia designs open source medical hardware that can be built at a fraction of the cost using 3d printing and alternative manufacturing methods. There are several projects in the works including oximeters, a loom for weaving gauze, and surgical tools &mdash; but my favorite is the [$5 {{page.pn}}]({{page.project}}).

Using DIY silicone molded earplugs, cheap PVC tubing, scrap plastic, and some 3D printed parts (ear tubes, y tube, and head), you can build your own stethoscope that performs as well the industry standard Littmann III. Once again, open source makes the world a better place!
